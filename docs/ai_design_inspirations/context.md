# Context for AI Design Inspirations

Given the current appearance of the app, I wanted to refine it slightly. 

I was able to use an AI image generation service and chatbot 
to generate a task list approximately to my liking using a series of prompts.
These are contained in this folder and will act as inspiration for the design from here.

I didn't work from these designs to begin with, because determining how the app would work needed to come first before designs could follow. 

These images will act as inspirations for the app work from here.

Design themes:

* Deep blue (#020154) as the main color for backgrounds and navigation 
* Elevated white cards with rounded corners and generous padding 
* Parent task, main task title, rounded priority pill, due date/time, subtask count, and checkboxes (The designs have these as red, which I'm undecided on)
* Vibrant, playful accents inspired by the Gouldian finch
